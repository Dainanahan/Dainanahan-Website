# DrugBank Parser
The dbparser package was written using the R programming language. It allows users to parse the data from DrugBank (http://drugbank.ca/), an online database that stores extensive and regularly curated information on drugs and their targets. More precisely, dbparser parses the DrugBank data (downloadable in XML format from: https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest) and stores the parsed data into R data frames for easy exploration. In addition, the parsed data may (optionally) be inserted into a local database (e.g. MySQL).
